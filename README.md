# FP3: Final Project Assignment 3: Exploration 2
Due Sunday, March 26, 2017

This assignment is the same as [FP1], except definitely choose a library that you expect to use for your full project.

You will be in your team before you complete this assignment. You and your teammate(s) must coordinate to (1) both choose libraries relevant to your project, and (2) each choose a different library.

The report template is below, beginning with "Library Name Here."


## Library Name Here
My name: Seokhwan Ko

racket/gui

*It is implemented under the Unix environment, but I also tested on the MS Windows.


## Play Report

My team has implemented basic structure for our project so far. And I created main window by using racket/gui.
Bascially, it shows up two content panels, and I tested menu bar and button work.
