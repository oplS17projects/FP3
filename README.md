## My Library: picturing-programs
My name: Chuong Vu

Honestly, this project we did not really relied much on the racket library because so far we have done by our own method to get the solution. We may or may not use another racket library but this is how far that we get.

For this project, I have use most with the picture-programs library.




* a narrative of what you did
* highlights of code that you wrote, with explanation
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* at least one diagram or figure showing your work

The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. 

You need at least one image (output, diagrams). Images must be uploaded to your repository, and then displayed with markdown in this file; like this:

![test image](/testimage.png?raw=true "test image")

You must provide credit to the source for any borrowed images.

Code should be delivered in two ways:

1. Full files should be added to your version of this repository.
1. Key excerpts of your code should be copied into this .md file, formatted to look like code, and explained.
