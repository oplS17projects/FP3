http://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server/run.html



I explored the web-server library specifically the servelet part.  This will be used to display our magic mirror.  As an experiment I made a [local] webpage. The webpage is fairly basic composed a title, a header, text, a picture and a hyperlink.  
The portnumber, hyperlink suffix can be tailored as needed.  There is as well an option for an external conneciton.

* highlights of code that you wrote, with explanation
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* at least one diagram or figure showing your work
```racket

```
The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. 

You need at least one image (output, diagrams). Images must be uploaded to your repository, and then displayed with markdown in this file; like this:

![test image]("ScreenShot.png")



Code should be delivered in two ways:

1. Full files should be added to your version of this repository.
1. Key excerpts of your code should be copied into this .md file, formatted to look like code, and explained.
