I explored the web-server library specifically the servelet part.  This will be used to display our magic mirror.  As an experiment I made a [local] webpage. The webpage is fairly basic composed a title, a header, text, a picture and a hyperlink.  
The portnumber, hyperlink suffix can be tailored as needed.  There is as well an option for an external conneciton. I was able to as well centered the main components of the webpage and will have to conintue to look at other ways to format (spatially) both texts, hyperlinks and images are positioned.
