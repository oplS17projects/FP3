## RtMidi
Samuel Toups

My plan was to use the RtMidi library to control a midi-capable piano I have. I want to do something with procedurally generated music, but I have run into a snag trying to get it working.

I have spent a good while trying to get the RtMidi library working. The RtMidi library is a wrapper around a c++ library of the same name for interracting with midi devices. Both the c++ library and the wrapper compile just fine, and I have all the shared object files and dev packages I think I need, but DrRacket keeps giving me messages about undefined symbols, which makes me think that I need to install packages in DrRacket for the underlying system libraries, but my google-fu has failed me, so I don't really know. I can't even get the example code for the library to run in DrRacket.
