### 2htdp/universe

creating animation

```racket
(define (create-scene width)
  (underlay/xy background width 160 timber-man-left))

(animate create-scene)
```
This will product an animation that move timber-man-left from left to right

I download all the asset from this [site](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2015/02/16/create-an-html5-game-like-timberman-in-a-matter-of-minutes-with-mightyeditor/)

The plan for this project to make the game similiar [timberman](http://www.crazygames.com/game/timberman)

I will be working on gui part and my partner will be doing the sound. Then finally we will combine it for the game.
