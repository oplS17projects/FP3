Our Project is going to be a stock recommender. It will automatically notify the user of stocks which fulfill certain criteria.

As such, my second exploration was to access a website which I have found to have excellent recommendations for stocks to buy.

This website is Barchart.com.

The code I included accesses the website, and prints out the raw code it finds.

The image below shows what the code actually does.
