Due Sunday, March 26, 2017

## simple-xlsx
My name: Kshitij Karke

Write what you did!
Remember that this report must include:

Initially I tried to look up some sort of an API for twitter, I did some reasearch and
found this https://lists.racket-lang.org/users/archive/2013-May/057838.html

Part of the step was to wait for an authorization key, I should have started before Sunday
and after deciding to wait a while for the key I completely forgot that the deadline for
FP3 was on Sunday.

The only reason I wanted to get this working is so we could somehow implement parsing tweets
of people online, when a stock (for example Apple) starts moving up or down people on twitter
start talking more about the stock on twitter and tag their thoughts using a $ (for example $APPL)

I tried again Monday and on Tuesday night decided to give something else a try, I tried to get familiar with simple-xlsx. Maybe in my project I can integrate sending the user a snapshot of their portfolio. Hopefully I can figure the twitter thing out because I wasted a lot of time trying to figure that out
