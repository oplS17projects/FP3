My name: **Molly McGuire**

What I did for this exploration was to look for comparable objects to the power -ups that a player gets when
playing the classic flash game 'Bubble Trouble 2'. When bubbles are successfully popped, they occassionaly 
drop power ups that grant the player longer time on the map, a shield, a special harpoon weapon, etc.

I did some research (played the game enough to find out what shapes are which) and I tried my hand at 
recreating those shapes that I saw- as well as displaying them as they would appear in the game itself.

This is demonstrated in the below picture.

My next step is to combine the knowledge that I have gained through these explorations with my partner so 
that we start working on the meat of the project.
