# FP3: Final Project Assignment 3: Exploration 2

## htdp/world
My name: Tim Barber

For FP3, I used the Rsound Library `(planet clements/rsound)` to load wav files from disk and play them back and I used the world library `htdp/world` to handle keyboard events. I realized that for the purpose of my project, it would be more useful to explore both libraries at the same time than to explore them seperatly.

What I created was a program that gave audio feedback depending on which keys were pressed. I implemented one sound on the left, right, up, and down arrow keys, a different sound to the space-bar, and a third sound to the escape key. I did this in preperation for the game idea we are going to implement in racket. I was hoping to handle keyboard input and give audible feedback to the user as they played the game. My key event handler looked as follows:

```
(define (change w a-key)
  (cond
    [(key=? a-key 'left)  (play (rs-read "Sound1.wav"))]
    [(key=? a-key 'right) (play (rs-read "Sound1.wav"))]
    [(key=? a-key 'up)    (play (rs-read "Sound1.wav"))]
    [(key=? a-key 'down)  (play (rs-read "Sound1.wav"))]
    [(key=? a-key #\space)  (play (rs-read "Sound2.wav"))]
    [(key=? a-key 'escape)  (play (rs-read "Sound3.wav"))]
    ))
```
To start this handler, you use `the on-key-event` function and pass it an expression that takes in two values, the state of the world that was created (unused in this instance) and the key-event itself. The key event can contain different objects, which are named according to the key pressed.

The Rsound library can only load 16-bit PCM waves, so I gathered 3 free sound effects and named them Sound1-3.wav. To load them from disk, you use the `rs-read` function, which returns an array of the PCM wav. That array can be read by the `play` function built into the Rsound library. For now, it seems to not route audio through the currently selected sound card (On macOS), so I will have to look into that in the future. 

The world that needs to be created is a window that is generated by the `big-bang` function, which creates a window with defined height and with. There are two more number parameters, but I have not figured out their use yet. This function is used to construct the world that the keyboard events exist in. The window must be in focus for the keyboard events to be registered.
